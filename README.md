# Changelog
MAY 03 2024
- Updated a few things


# This will cover only the following
- GOD EATER BURST (USA, JP, EUR)
- GOD EATER 2 (JP) [there wasn't many tools so there's only small content for this one]



# [What is WikiEater]
- to be honest, i only made repository for fun and sharing my knowledge to everyone i guess, maybe someday i could expand this to the other GOD EATER GAMES (except 3 since i believe its been documented)


# Contents
- GOD EATER BURST + GOD EATER 2 - Related to older games (ADDING MORE GE2 content really soon if there's any tool for it to extract everything that the game has + DLC content too.)



# Note
- Check around the folders to read the .md files, You can always contribute as well.. if you want to :)


# Giving my thanks:
- Major Thanks for [HaoJun0823](https://github.com/HaoJun0823) and their teams `(i think they have a team to do this?)` for releasing a very cool tool [GECV](https://github.com/HaoJun0823/GECV), the tool is really important for me to document later on in the future..
- [gil-unx](https://github.com/gil-unx) for [GEBCS](https://github.com/gil-unx/GEBCS), this little documentation of mine wouldn't exists without this tool
- [nyrish](https://github.com/nyirsh) for [GEBUtils](https://github.com/nyirsh/GEBUtils), this tool helpled to extract dlc contents even though its a bit broken
- [Saramagrean](https://github.com/Saramagrean) for [GE2 Insert Script](https://github.com/Saramagrean/GE2-insert-script-tool)
- [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) for the God Eater 2 Script
