# Giving my thanks:
- Major Thanks for [HaoJun0823](https://github.com/HaoJun0823) and their teams `(i think they have a team to do this?)` for releasing a very cool tool [GECV](https://github.com/HaoJun0823/GECV), the tool is really important for me to document later on in the future..
- [gil-unx](https://github.com/gil-unx) for [GEBCS](https://github.com/gil-unx/GEBCS), this little documentation of mine wouldn't exists without this tool
- [nyrish](https://github.com/nyirsh) for [GEBUtils](https://github.com/nyirsh/GEBUtils), this tool helpled to extract dlc contents even though its a bit broken
- [Saramagrean](https://github.com/Saramagrean) for [GE2 Insert Script](https://github.com/Saramagrean/GE2-insert-script-tool)
- [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) for the God Eater 2 Script
