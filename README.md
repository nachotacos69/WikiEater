# This will cover only the following
- GOD EATER BURST (USA, JP, EUR) [mostly here are GEB content]
- GOD EATER 2 (JP) [there wasn't many tools so there's only small content for this one]


I will cover some nice things i suppose,
 always make an issue to correct some things :)




# [Here i will list some GOD EATER PSP TOOLS]



***1. [GEBCS](https://github.com/gil-unx/GEBCS) by gilunx***

**Good Things**
- Supports only GOD EATER BURST (USA, JP, EUR)
- Can extract all of the contents within package.rdp of GOD EATER BURST
- Can modify some parts here and there (slightly).



**Bad Things**
- Slight modification can lead to some issues, although modifying the text indexes doesn't lead to bad things.
- Mostly changing models whatsoever is very incompatible
- Adding some extra things makes the tool crash.
- Supports the very first version of GOD EATER but it gets corrupted with a couple of text modification




***2. [GEBUtils](https://github.com/nyirsh/GEBUtils) by nyirsh***

**Good Things**
- Supports only GOD EATER BURST (USA, JP, EUR)
- supports DLC 1.0 to 1.61
- can extract slightly on package.rdp and the dlc contents

**Bad Things**
- Limits your modification by notifying you if a specific file is big or a few bytes free during repacking.
- DLC modification corrupts pretty easily.




***3. [GE2 Script](https://github.com/Saramagrean/GE2-insert-script-tool) by Saramagrean***

**Good Things**
- Only supports 1.30 iso version
- Supports 1.30 DLC
- Can extract and modify text indexes

**Bad Things**
- incompatible to other version since it's for 1.30
- It only does text modification, and it won't let you modify the texts for combat radio texts.
- lacks full modification of package.rdp/data.rdp.
- DLC have rare chances to be inflate into 1+ GB for no reason, it's the scripts fault commonly



***4. [GOD EATER 2 BMS Script] from QuickBMS***

**Good Things**
- Supports GE2RB since it's made truly for the vita version based on research
- Supports ISO 1.0 to 1.40
- Nothing Much but can extract a few contents of package.rdp / data.rdp

**Bad Things**
- No DLC Support/Modification
- Most file are corrupted and rather in a broken state
- Unorganized file positions
- Overall, bad experience from using it

Note: It's up to you for whatever you need to do
