***[GE2 Script](https://github.com/Saramagrean/GE2-insert-script-tool) by Saramagrean***

**Good Things**
- Only supports 1.30 iso version
- Supports 1.30 DLC
- Can extract and modify text indexes

**Bad Things**
- incompatible to other version since it's for 1.30
- It only does text modification, and it won't let you modify the texts for combat radio texts.
- lacks full modification of package.rdp/data.rdp.
- DLC have rare chances to be inflate into 1+ GB for no reason, it's the scripts fault commonly

# Guide and Usage:
- Place 1.30 ISO and renaming the iso to `GE2Base.iso`
- Rename DLC `NPJH50832` to `MOD-IND` and create a `GAME`
  folder inside the tool so you can move in the dlc inside `GAME` folder

Notes:
- This only supports **1.30 ISO** and **1.30 DLC**
- All the .py file (python script) are only patching the .iso and dlc
- All texts are in the `GOD_EATER_2/TRANSLATE_INDONESIA` folder
- Sadly the tools only function is to only change texts,and nothing else
- modifying `AUDIOTEXT` doesnt work for some reason
  (also it is related to the game's combat radio during missions)
- If the DLC `PATCH.EDAT` inflates to 1GB+, it's the tool's commlonly fault
  there is no current fix for that since the tool is probably abandoned
  and you have to go back and forth to redo your patching, and always recheck
  your translation
