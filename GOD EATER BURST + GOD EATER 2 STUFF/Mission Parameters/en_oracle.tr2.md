# TOPIC - ARAGAMI ORACLE


# Understanding the column names and purposes
Heads Up: i usually don't have the idea on the other names but i will give my understanding on these few column names

- `en_oracle_bullet_id` (INT16) - aragami oracle ID based on current aragami
- `en_oracle_wait` (INT16) - its somekind of waiting value
