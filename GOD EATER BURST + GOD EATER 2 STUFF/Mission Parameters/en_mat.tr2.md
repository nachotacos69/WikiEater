# TOPIC - ARAGAMI MATERIAL


# Understanding the column names and purposes
Heads Up: i usually don't have the idea on the other names but i will give my understanding on these few column names

- `en_mat_article_id` (INT16) - aragami material ID based on current aragami, check `article.tr2` in `\system\god_menu\nodbg`
- `en_mat_wait` (INT16) - its somekind of waiting value
