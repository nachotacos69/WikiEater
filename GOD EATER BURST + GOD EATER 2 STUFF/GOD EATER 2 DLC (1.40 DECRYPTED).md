# TOPIC - DLC Explanation (GOD EATER 2 1.40 DECRYPTED)

- I didn't include 1.40 ENCRYPTED due to it being encrypted of course

 - Currently i have no idea on how to extract contents of the DLC..
 - the DLC though has uses a magic header hex of `50 72 65 73 20` which is `Pres `?
 - it contains `blz - (62 6C 7A)`/`blz2 - (62 6C 7A 32)` for some reason?
 - `at3x - (00 61 74 33 78)` can be found
 - `pmf - (00 70 6D 66)` can be found
 - `kst - (00 6B 73 74)` can be found
 - `tr2 - (00 74 72 32)` can be found
 - `res - (00 72 65 73)` can be found
 - `gmo - (00 67 6D 6F)` can be found
 - `gim - (00 67 69 6D)` can be found
 - `conf - (00 63 6F 6E 66)` can be found
 - `bap - (00 62 61 70)` can be found
 - `bin - (00 62 69 6E)` can be found
 - `vag - (00 76 61 67)` can be found
 - that's all i can really find
