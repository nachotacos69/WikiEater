***[GOD EATER 2 BMS Script] from QuickBMS***

**Good Things**
- Supports GE2RB since it's made truly for the vita version based on research
- Supports ISO 1.0 to 1.40
- Nothing Much but can extract a few contents of package.rdp / data.rdp

**Bad Things**
- No DLC Support/Modification
- Most file are corrupted and rather in a broken state
- Unorganized file positions
- Overall, bad experience from using it


# Usage
- drag the `god_eater_2.bms` script to the `quickbms.exe`
- another screen would pop after the command prompt screen
  then select `package.rdp` or `data.rdp` (it's up to you to explore)
- then select an output folder
- then it will extract the .rdp contents
  (sadly they are really unorganized an some are readable and some aren't)
- afterwards it will give you some results after the extraction
  then press any key to quit
- you should see tons of numbered folders on the output folder
- (yes its very messed up)


Notes:
- this tool deflates the following:
  `Pres` `rdp` `blz` `RIFF` `zlib`
- the tool is barely usable and i am sure it has been abandoned
- overall, i have good and bad experiences with this
