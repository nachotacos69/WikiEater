# TOPIC - ARAGAMI HIT ATTACK PARAMETERS

# Understanding the column names and purposes
Heads Up: i usually don't have the idea on the other names but i will give my understanding on these few column names

- `en_hit_attack_ascii_name` (ASCII) - aragami hit attack names.. thats it
- `en_hit_attack_id` (UINT16) - hit attack ID.. nothing much i can learn
- `en_hit_attack_id_timing_array` - their list are different, usually a short list or long list depends on the aragami stuff. and i have no idea for their purpose
