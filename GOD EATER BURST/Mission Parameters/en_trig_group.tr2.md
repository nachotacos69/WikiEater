# TOPIC - ARAGAMI TRIGGER GROUP

# Understanding the column names and purposes
Heads Up: i usually don't have the idea on the other names but i will give my understanding on these few column names

- `en_trig_group_display_name` (UTF-8) - displays the texts when you break a bond/parts
- `en_trig_group_parts_hp` (UINT16) - usually they have 4 values?. Health Points for the bond/parts, can't confirm so just check around
- `en_trig_group_mat_id_array` (UINT16)- their list and values are usually different, related to aragami materials when you break the bonds/parts?
- `en_trig_group_weight_group_id_array` (UINT8)- their list and values are usually different, its a somekind of chance/percentage drop rate something like that
- `en_trig_group_break_count` (UINT8) - their values are different.. its something related to break counts.. share me your thoughts on this one
- `en_trig_group_rage_flg` (UINT8) - this is related to a bond/part, when it is destroyed, this will trigger **enraged**. if the aragami is already **enraged**, there will no effect i believe
- `en_trig_group_replace_parts_name` (ASCII) - names for all aragami bonds/parts in their other broken bond models
