# TOPIC - ARAGAMI DEFENSE PARAMETERS

# Understanding the column names and purposes
Heads Up: i usually don't have the idea on the other names but i will give my understanding on these few column names

- `en_def_normal_elm` (INT16) - their list are randomized, each one of them related to elemental attacks:
  + Sunder
  + Crush
  + Pierce
  + $\color{rgb(255, 80, 80)}{\textsf{Blaze}}$
  + $\color{rgb(51, 153, 255)}{\textsf{Freeze}}$
  + $\color{#e6e600}{\textsf{Thunder}}$
  + $\color{#cc66ff}{\textsf{Divine}}$
  + $\color{#bf00ff}{\textsf{Venom/Poison}}$
  + $\color{#0086b3}{\textsf{Bind}}$
     ~ Where's the $\color{#ffff80}{\textsf{Hold}}$ effect you might ask?, probably because they dont deal damage at all.
-  `en_def_angry_elm` (INT16) - their list are randomized, related to **enraged** form, making them stronger, the list is still the same as `en_def_normal_elm`
-  `en_def_destruct_elm` (INT16) - their list are randomized, related to broken bonds/parts, making them weaker?, the list is still the same as `en_def_normal_elm`
-  `en_def_angry_destruct_elm`(INT16) - their list are randomized, related to **enraged** form, making them stronger, the list is still the same as `en_def_normal_elm`
-  `en_def_name` - Aragami defense name.. thats it
