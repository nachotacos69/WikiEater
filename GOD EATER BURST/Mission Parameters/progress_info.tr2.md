# TOPIC - PROGRESS INFO

# Understanding the column names and purposes
Heads Up: i usually don't have the idea on the other names but i will give my understanding on these few column names


- `progress_info_quest_index` (UINT8) - and index for how many aragamis are listed in the mission.
- `progress_info_enemy_name` (UTF-8) - aragamis name that will be listed
- `progress_info_enemy_id` (UINT8) - ID for the aragamis, it serves a purpose to which aragami will spawn first (1 will be the first)
- `progress_info_enemy_num` (UINT8) - this serves a counter for the player, to notify them how many aragamis are needed to be killed (example: if its 2, then it will be 2)
- `progress_info_enemy_flag` (UINT8) - cannot be documented, since its zero
