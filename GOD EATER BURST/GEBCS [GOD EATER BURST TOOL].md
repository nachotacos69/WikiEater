***[GEBCS First Version](https://github.com/nachotacos69/GEBCS) by gilunx, archived by: nachotacos69***

**Good Things**
- Supports only GOD EATER BURST (USA, JP, EUR)
- Can extract all of the contents within package.rdp of GOD EATER BURST
- Can modify lots of things here and there (except for some parts for `First Version`).
- DLC Support (except for `First Version`)



**Bad Things**
- Mostly changing models whatsoever is very incompatible `This happens if you mishandle it`
- Adding some extra things makes the tool crash. `Due to nesting?`
- Supports the very first version of GOD EATER but it gets corrupted with a couple of text modification 

# Usage
- Extract the script somewhere that you want it to be then extract
  `package.rdp`, and `system.res` from the GEB iso and put it inside **GEBCS** main directory folder
  example:

- open command prompt, and type `GEBCS`, this will display the tool's usage
  **Unpack: GEBCS.exe -x, Repack: GEBCS.exe -c**
- type `GEBCS -x` to extract `package.rdp` contents, this will take time
- after extracting, there will be a folder named **system**, that's where the contents are inside


Notes:
- some stuff can and can't be modified
- avoid overlapping the base file size when modifying a specific file (example is the .at3 audio files)
